# Version constraints for pip-installation.
#
# This file doesn't install any packages. It specifies version constraints
# that will be applied if a package is needed.
#
# When pinning something here, please provide an explanation of why.  Ideally,
# link to other information that will help people in the future to remove the
# pin when possible.  Writing an issue against the offending project and
# linking to it here is good.

# diff-cover latest requires (pluggy>=0.13.1,<0.14.0)
# which conflicts with pytest(pluggy>=0.12,<2.0.0) and tox(pluggy>0.12) both of these fetch pluggy==1.0.0
# but diff-cover latest has a pin (pluggy<1.0.0a1)
# Using the same version of diff-cover which is being used currently in edx-platform to avoid this conflict.
