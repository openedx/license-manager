10. Automatically activate subscription licenses upon login via SSO
======================

Status

Accepted

Context
=======

Currently, the only way to access the Enterprise Learner Portal (frontend-app-learner-portal-enterprise) is by named invitation from an administrator. That is, an administrator must explicitly assign a subsidy to learners (e.g., license, code) from the Enterprise Admin Portal (frontend-app-admin-portal) in order to gain access to the learner experience. However, many customers use an external LMS to direct their existing learners to edX content via single-sign on (SSO). In this scenario, administrators need to both administer learners within the external LMS and a second time in the Enterprise Admin Portal.

As such, we would like to automatically activate subscription licenses for learners who are linked (via SSO) to an enterprise with a subscription plan and have at least one available license to allocate when they access the Enterprise Learner Portal from their external LMS. This will allow enterprise learners to enroll in courses without intervention from an administrator to manually grant access. Note that SSO-based learners who receive an auto-applied subscription license will not be required to click an activation link in their emails as their licenses will be immediately activated.

Decision
========

In order to support subscription licenses that are automatically applied and activated upon login when accessing the Enterprise Learner Portal, we will:

* Create a new field on the ``CustomerAgreement`` model to allow configuration of which subscription plans associated with a ``CustomerAgreement`` have automatically applied licenses enabled. This field will allow selection of a single subscription plan. By only allowing selection of one plan, we will remove ambiguity around needing to have business logic to naively choose which subscription plan for which the auto-applied license should be allocated.
* In the Enterprise Learner Portal, we will check to see whether the learner has an existing subscription license, if the customer has an identity provider (i.e., uses SSO), and whether the auto-applied licenses flag is enabled for the enterprise customer's subscription plan(s). If the learner does not have a license, the flag is enabled and the customer has an identity provider, we will POST to a new API endpoint in license-manager to automatically activate an unused license, assuming one is available.
* This API endpoint will be an action on the ``CustomerAgreementViewSet`` such that the backend can appropriately determine which plan, if any, may have a license auto-applied based on the selected plan. The API will determine this based on new field introduced on the ``CustomerAgreement`` model. This also gives the flexibility to disallow certain plans from supporting auto-applied licenses without blocking the feature from all subscription plans associated with the ``CustomerAgreement``.
* The new API endpoint will also ensure the auto-apply licenses flag is enabled, check whether there are any unassigned licenses available in the eligible subscription plan that supports auto-applied licenses and, if so, automatically activate one unused license for the enterprise learner.
* If the API request is successful (i.e., an auto-applied license was activated), the course detail page content will be displayed as usual, now with a valid license for which the learner may enroll in courses without payment. Messaging will be displayed to the learner to inform them they were granted an activated license. The existing "Welcome to edX Subscriptions" onboarding email should only be sent to learners for auto-applied licenses if the enterprise customer has the "Enable learner portal search for LMS customers" flag checked, as the email template includes a link to the Enterprise Learner Portal's Dashboard page which is not readily accessible with the flag unchecked since it removes the "Dashboard" and "Find a Course" links in the header. If that flag is unchecked, we will send a separate onboarding email related to license access for the SSO-specific use case. Additionally, the newly activated license will be marked as having been auto-applied for historical records.
* If the API request errors (i.e., an auto-applied license could not be activated), the course detail page content will be displayed as usual but with an appropriate error message and enrolling in the course will still require the learner to pay out-of-pocket (i.e., a link to the ecommerce basket page); any error(s) will be logged.
* Once the license is auto-applied (i.e., activated), it will appear on the "Subscription Management" page in the Enterprise Admin Portal should the administrator need to revoke the license in the future.
* If a learner already has an activated license, this API request will be bypassed.
* If a learner has an assigned license, we will continue to show the existing ``Alert`` messaging around needing to activate their license via the license activation email they should have received upon license assignment and bypass this auto-applied license logic.
* If a learner has a previously revoked license, we will also bypass the API request for an auto-applied license. In this case, an administrator explicitly revoked access previously and to avoid a cat and mouse game of revoking and getting an auto-applied license the next time that learner comes to the Enterprise Learner Portal, we will simply not support auto-applied licenses for previously learners who have a previously revoked license.
* When a subscription plan's renewal is processed for a plan with auto-applied licenses enabled, we will ensure the selection field on the ``CustomerAgreement`` model is updated to point instead to the now renewed subscription plan versus the original subscription plan. This will reduce the manual configuration needed by ECS to manage auto-applied licenses during renewals.
* In order to support the possibility of wanting to disable auto-applied licenses upon renewal (i.e., turn off auto-applied licenses for a plan once a renewal is done processing), a flag will be added to the ``SubscriptionPlanRenewal`` model to allow ECS to automatically disable auto-applied licenses after the renewal processing completes.
* For subscription plan renewals, we agreed to have a renewal processing lock period of 12 hours where an administrator may not invite new learners or revoke learners while the renewal is in this processing period. As a result, we will not be able to automatically apply licenses in this period because licenses are copied from the renewed plan into the future plan during renewal processing so the license states must be stable without modifications at the beginning of the renewal lock period to avoid dropping any recent additions/revocations. That said, we will not support auto-applied licenses when a subscription plan is in the renewal processing window.
* If the subscription plan selected for auto-applied licenses expires, we will unselect it from the plan selection field on the ``CustomerAgreement`` model. If there is another existing active and current subscription plan, it must be manually selected in order for auto-applied licenses to take effect again.

By having the API endpoint determine  which subscription plan(s) to auto-apply a license, we limit the amount of business logic needed in the frontend. The frontend will only determine whether the learner is applicable for an auto-applied license by virtue of not having an existing license and the flag for auto-applied licenses being enabled; if an auto-applied license is not applicable for the learner and/or customer, the API call will not happen.

The solution outlined above restricts the auto-apply licenses functionality to SSO customers since we know they are valid users for this enterprise already. If we were to generalize this solution to non-SSO customers as well, any learner who reaches a customer's Learner Portal by chance would be granted a license and linked to the enterprise customer even though they have no association to the customer. We may revisit this solution in the future to account for auto-applying licenses to learners who use a "magic link" and/or for customers who are configured to use allowlisted email domain(s).

Consequences
============

* We may run into situations where all licenses are already allocated (i.e., no unassigned licenses available to activate) and the admin is unaware. We will set up an email notification via Braze to the administrator when this situation occurs. Related, there will be an email notification sent to administrators when 75% of their licenses have been allocated to catch this proactively through other existing work.
* If there are multiple plans in which today's date falls between their respective start and expiration dates, how will the system determine which plan should be used for the automically applied license? This ADR assumes there will be, at most, a single subscription plan explicitly marked for auto-applied licenses for any given ``CustomerAgreement``. By only supporting a single plan that may be used for auto-applied licenses, we will not be able to support auto-applied licenses for multiple plans running concurrently (e.g., one plan for a Computer Science catalog and another plan for a Marketing catalog). However, this use case is not something we support today; as such, we will revisit this decision should that use case arise in the future.
* The solution, for now, only applies to SSO-based enterprise customers. In order to support the conditional sending of the subscriptions onboarding email to learners, license-manager will need to be aware of the "Enable learner portal search for LMS customers" flag and whether the enterprise customer has an identity provider (these data only live in the edx-platform database via edx-enterprise). Similar to how we fetch the enterprise customer's slug when saving/updating a ``CustomerAgreement`` record, we will also need to ensure we keep this flag in sync between both edx-enterprise and license-manager. The Django action to manually refresh the enterprise slug may be expanded to retrieve the slug in addition to the current flag setting and whether the enterprise customer has an identity provider from edx-enterprise.
* Lack of support for auto-applied licenses in the 12-hour renewal processing window. Learners and administrators will need to wait until the plan's renewal is officially processed before auto-applied licenses can function. This decision means that learners navigating to the Enterprise Learner Portal will not be able to enroll in courses without payment until the renewal has been fully processed.
* A learner with a revoked license will not be eligible for an auto-applied license. If an administator would like to give this learner access to another license, they must explicitly assign a license to that learner with the "Subscription Management" page in the Enterprise Admin Portal.

Alternatives Considered
============

* Update the ``handle_user_post_save`` Django signal in edx-enterprise to make a synchronous API call to license-manager to retrieve any license(s) associated with a learner and make an additional API call to auto-apply a new license, if applicable. This signal is called any time a user logistrates into the platform, which could easily be an unnecessarily excessive load on the license-manager service. Additionally, the communication between license-manager and edx-enterprise is currently solely one way; that is, license-manager makes API calls to edx-enterprise but edx-enterprise does not currently make any API calls to license-manager.
