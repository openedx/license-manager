        Having now used {{ NUM_REVOCATIONS_APPLIED }} revocations, this enterprise will be unable to
        revoke additional activated licenses from learners, and this feature will be disabled within
        their administration portal. They will still be able to revoke and reassign pending licenses,
        which have never been previously activated.
